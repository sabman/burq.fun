We provide developers with an easy to use API to quickly import, query and update their data without needing to worry about the backend management, maintenance and scaling. The service makes it really easy for developers to build advanced Geospatial applications directly via their iPhone, Android or WP7 SDKs. SpacialDB also integrates with existing cloud hosting services such as Heroku, Engine Yard, Joyent and Rackspace for Web apps. In 2015 it was acquired by QGISCloud",
